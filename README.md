#  Saved and load models

Model progress can be saved during and after training. This means a model can resume where it left off and avoid long training times. Saving also means you can share your model and others can recreate your work. When publishing reseach mdeols and techniques, most machine learning practitioners share:
- code to create the model, and
- the trained weights, or parameters, for the model

Sharing this data helps others undestand how the model works and try it themselves with new data
